This is a brief tutorial for performing basic computations using the E6B flight computer on a pilot watch.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

# What is an E6B?

An E6B flight computer is a circular slide rule used by pilots to make common aviation calculations. A pilot watch typically contains a simplified version of a full E6B like the one shown below.

A US Navy officer developed the E6B—or "whiz wheel"—in the 1930s and it was first used on a large scale in WWII[^e6b]. The design is pretty much unchanged since then and every student pilot learns how to make basic calculations for flight planning using a standard E6B. It found its way onto a watch with the Navitimer pilot watch introduced by Breitling in the 1950s[^navimeter], and we will use the popular [Citizen Skyhawk](https://www.citizenwatch.com/us/en/product/JY8075-51E.html) ([manual](https://cf-store.widencdn.net/citizenwatch/9/b/d/9bd923da-d55c-49d6-994a-9ee040b9200a.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22U680_full_instructions_DEFAULT.pdf%22&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&Expires=1601093068&Signature=WIr5VlbfLJvIRCz~ut9sEhfGwwhVtJ~~Wt7mBp19SoBylcw8Swuvv-vgZr9N4GpcWC6Di8CDz6QD33SQzWnKokLiW4wU4XGI~Kc6M~c4U8RvAv~jIGJANLoNsgp7bmfiGQgzgwu~5tzcBYB9ZEdXGOuT8d8b3~DVxbF12d~UdYLme330rceMepnzD6ixcqM13Us3bhPBayYYZ2q9EP8HfuIs-plVnjMG2pnM4x0AlpztPybE8quxvoJPHwxECuTgaGlwTQS~n-Q9hFCAb-aO~JucKW7kYWlVzXRTwDJizhQ~brd5XFqRvY-fEN3Zikbk-dc5VbEdRtASab7vHEvPNg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJD5XONOBVWWOA65A)) for these examples.

# Examples

The pilot watch, like a standard E6B, consists of two concentric scales, one of which rotates. Notice that both have special markings for the **10** position. We will reference one or the other of these frequently to identify the solution opposite them. Here are two helpful videos ([one](https://youtu.be/vSUHCkvmYnE), [two](https://youtu.be/tOMuTMUJLcs)) for using a pilot watch, and I'll borrow a couple of examples from them.

## Division

The most common computations on a pilot watch involve multiplication and division. We will start with division since it is the most straightforward: simply rotate the bezel so the two numbers to divide are over each other and read the result opposite the **10**.

## Multiplication

Since division is easy to remember, the multiplication method I prefer is the exact opposite. Set the first number to multiply opposite the red **10**, go to the second number to multiply on the inner bezel, and read the answer opposite it.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}../images/citizen-skyhawk-e6b/03-multiplication-1.png" width="75%" height="75%"></p>

An alternative method is to rotate the white **10** opposite the first number, find the second number on the outer bezel, and read the result on the inner bezel opposite from it.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}../images/citizen-skyhawk-e6b/04-multiplication-2.png" width="75%" height="75%"></p>

Here is another multiplication example:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}../images/citizen-skyhawk-e6b/05-multiplication-example.png" width="75%" height="75%"></p>

Inevitably I will forget exactly how to set the bezels and whether to read off the inside or outside one. To remind myself, I pick a simple relationship that I know the answer to, and use that pattern to do the multiplication or division I can't do in my head.


## Conversions

The pilot watch has markings for several conversions including distance and fuel units. For example, it is easy to convert distance between nautical miles, statute miles, and kilometers.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}../images/citizen-skyhawk-e6b/06-conversion.png" width="75%" height="75%"></p>


You can also convert between pounds and kilograms:

## Descent

In this example we calculate the distance from an airport to start a descent. 

1. First, divide the altitude to descend by the desired descent rate to calculate the time to descend.
2. Next, determine your speed in <code>nm/min</code> by dividing your speed in knots (<code>nm/hr</code>) by 60 either using the watch or mentally.
3. Finally, multiply the time to descend by your groundspeed to calculate the distance from the airport to start the descent. 

If you are able to complete step 2 in your head, you can get straight to the answer with the outer bezel set in one position as show below.
