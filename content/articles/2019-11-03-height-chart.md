My wife came across an idea of a [height chart](https://abeautifulmess.com/2019/10/wooden-height-chart-diy.html) for measuring the kids and this was a fun afternoon project.

### Notes

I bought a nice pine 1 x 6 x 6' board at Lowes. In addition to the unfinished lumber they have a decent selection of finished maple, oak, and pine.

The first step was to cut the slots for the foot markers. I used a straight 1/4" router bit and cut to a depth of about 1/8" or 3/16". To help make the cuts quick and consistent, I made a jig with two pieces of scrap wood held together with a clamp to serve as a guide for the router. This make for a quick process of marking and then cutting all 5 slots. Blue masking tape really helps minimize tear-out, and I went over any rough areas with 400 grit sandpaper.

I then used a [Sharpie pro](https://www.amazon.com/Sharpie-Permanent-Marker-Point-2018321/dp/B07DPMKZ8G/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=sharpie+pro&qid=1572828537&sr=8-4) to color each slot, being careful to not let the marker touch the upper edges since it will bleed. Shallower slots help with this process. 

Next I used a [round over bit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D8R3F7K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to make a nice smooth edge along the perimeter of the board. 

For finish, I applied 3 coats of wipe-on poly. After it was dry, I rubbed the whole board down with a piece of cardboard to knock down any high spots from the finish.

Next it was time to mount the numbers. I got small black screws to use instead of the nails provided with the numbers. After drilling clearance holes for the screws, I mounted numbers 3, 4, and 5. 

The hang the chart I used two drywall anchors hidden under numbers 2 and 6. This was the main reason for using screws to mount the numbers so that they are easily removed if I ever want to remove the chart from the wall. After mounting to the wall, I installed numbers 2 and 6 to complete the project.
